* Adding Volume and Issue to the Starter Site
* Add "Source Title" field? Best term to use. We picked Parent Publication Title
* TO DO: PR against REST OAI-PMH to include volume, issue, (source title?) in MODS.
* See [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zS_WeQdFIVFYobTeD4ub-Ky5B_wMIKSAdwx8A1iAVEY/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p)
* Dream Big - When we first started, we thought Drupal fields were the best way, but we might be losing metadata. Now is the time to extend Drupal to what we need
* MODS, display label, one field for abstract or description. Allowing fields to have display labels. One field with different labels chosen by the ingester.
* Hierarchical geographical terms to keep terms nested from big to small. Multiple sections within one hierarchy of geographical fields. In the current Drupal, values are being mixed with higher values. Values should display together as a hierarchy.
* Field type to export content to citation.
* A word of caution: if we get to customize, it will not work well with Workbench, merging, and other Drupal features.
* Crosswalk to Dublin Core
