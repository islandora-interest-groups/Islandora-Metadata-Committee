### Notes:
* Announcements
  * Membership Lists - If you would like to be a member, put name in chat or contact Rosie to be added. You can attend a meeting even if you aren't a member
  * Meeting invites went out members.
  * Looking for a third Co-Convener. Reach out to Rosie if interested
* Documentation Discussion
  * Attempt to make documentation that is more friendly to non-Drupal experts.
  * Open discussion about documentation outline - concerns that maybe it is still to Drupal-ish.
  * Field Types moves up because it needs to be determined right after the label. Some of the labels are confusing/non-intuitive.
    * Maybe high-level discussion of the difference between direct (free/open text fields) and controlled fields (attached to taxonomies or other forms of controlled terms).
    * Some fields maybe will be lower priority, like Binary or Number, may not have as much documentation.
  * Content Types
    *  Maybe just link to external information and/or highlight the difference between Repo Item and other content types
  *  Model
    * Model, Weight, Member of are baked in Islandora structural fields. Should be covered early.
* Adding volume and issue to Starter Site
  * Rosie created a [pull request](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora-starter-site/pull/220) and recorded a screen capture of the process. Rosie will convert it to a youtube video for the community.
  * RDF - finding a good predicate for Volume and Issue. [Bibo volume](https://dcmi.github.io/bibo/#:volume) looks good, but [Bibo issue](https://dcmi.github.io/bibo/#:issue) could be a problem due to the domain :Issue.
  * Possible that in Bibo volume is is more about multivolume sets.
  * Checked out DC Bibliographic Citation 
  * Also looked at mods:titleInfo and mods:part for possibilities.
  * Did not come up with a solution, more research is needed. 
* Typed Relation fields
  * Time ran out before Rosie presented this. 

### Next Meeting
